      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Choosing the right medical aid payment method can significantly impact your long-term financial health. 
        This analysis examines the two primary payment approaches—salary deductions and personal payments—to 
        help you make an informed decision based on concrete financial data and practical considerations.

        <h3>Tax Bracket Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Your tax bracket significantly affects the financial advantage of salary deductions. 
          Since medical aid contributions through salary deductions are made before tax calculation, 
          the higher your tax bracket, the greater your tax savings. Use the selector below to see 
          how different tax brackets affect your potential savings.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        When properly accounting for percentage improvements over time, salary deductions offer increasingly 
        better financial value—starting at 2.45% in the first year and growing to 2.99% by year ten through 
        compounding effects alone. When including tax advantages, this improvement can reach significantly higher 
        percentages depending on your tax bracket.
      </p>
      <p>
        For individuals in higher tax brackets (39-45%), the financial advantage is particularly substantial, 
        potentially saving tens of thousands of Rand over a decade. However, the right choice still depends on 
        your specific circumstances, employment stability, and preference for flexibility versus efficiency.
